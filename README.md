# NewCityNameGenerator

In this project a recurrent neural network has been trained on the dataset containing the names of all the sub-districts in India using Tflearn. This uses long short term memory RNN architecture to train on the prexsisting data set to come up with novel names of subdistricts that dont exist.

New names generated are like
* Chanra
* Karla
* Macham
* Gha

# Dependencies

* tflearn (https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn)
* six

# Basic Usage

python citygenerator.py
